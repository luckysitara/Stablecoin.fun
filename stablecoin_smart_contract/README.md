# stable.fun

**stable.fun** is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain for creating and managing stablecoins. The goal of the project is to provide an easy, secure, and scalable way to create stablecoins that are pegged to various assets, ensuring stability in price and usage.

## Key Features

- **Stablecoin Creation**: Users can mint their own stablecoins pegged to different assets (e.g., USD, EUR, etc.).
- **Decentralized Control**: Operates fully on the Solana blockchain, ensuring decentralization and trustless transactions.
- **High Throughput**: Built on Solana for fast and efficient transactions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale as the demand for stablecoins grows.
- **Security**: Leverages robust cryptographic principles and Solana's high-security features.

## Installation

To get started with the **stable.fun** project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luckysitara/stable.fun.git
   cd stable.fun
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Rust and Solana CLI installed on your system.
   - Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
   - Install [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Deploy the smart contract**:
   After building, deploy the smart contract to Solana Devnet/Testnet/Mainnet.
   ```bash
   solana program deploy target/deploy/stable_fun.so
   ```

5. **Run tests** (Optional):
   Run the unit tests and integration tests for smart contracts:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Usage

- **Minting Stablecoins**: Use the platform's UI or CLI to mint stablecoins pegged to various assets.
- **Transactions**: Transfer stablecoins easily within the ecosystem.
- **Stability Mechanism**: The project uses algorithms to ensure that the stablecoin maintains its peg to the target asset.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract for **stable.fun** is written in Rust using the Solana program library. This contract handles the creation, minting, and management of stablecoins on the blockchain.

### Key Functions:
- **Minting**: Allows users to create new stablecoins.
- **Burning**: Provides the mechanism for users to redeem stablecoins for underlying assets.
- **Transfers**: Enables stablecoin transfers between users.

For a detailed description of the smart contract logic, please refer to the `smart_contract` folder in the repository.
