# stable.fun - Stablecoin Factory  
A decentralized platform for creating and managing custom stablecoins on Solana, backed by yield-bearing government bonds.  

## Overview  
stable.fun is a web3 application that enables users to create and manage their own custom stablecoins on the Solana blockchain. Each stablecoin is fully collateralized by Stablebonds (yield-bearing government bonds), ensuring stability and transparency.  

## Features  
- **Custom Stablecoin Creation**: Create personalized stablecoins with custom names, symbols, and branding.  
- **Bond-Backed Stability**: All stablecoins are fully collateralized by government bonds.  
- **Real-Time Price Feeds**: Integration with Switchboard oracles for accurate price data.  
- **Mint & Redeem**: Easily mint new stablecoins or redeem them for the underlying bond collateral.  
- **Portfolio Management**: Track and manage all your created stablecoins in one place.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Frontend**:  
  - React 18+  
  - TypeScript  
  - Tailwind CSS  
  - Vite  
  - Solana Wallet Adapter  

- **Smart Contracts**:  
  - Rust  
  - Anchor Framework  
  - Solana Program Library (SPL)  
  - Switchboard (Oracle Integration)  

## Prerequisites  
- Node.js 16+  
- Rust and Cargo  
- Solana CLI  
- Anchor CLI  
- A Solana wallet (Phantom or Solflare recommended)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ge0frey/stable.fun.git
   cd stable.fun
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install  

   # Install Anchor dependencies
   cd stablecoin-factory  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Build the Solana program:  
   ```bash
   cd stablecoin-factory  
   anchor build  
   ```  

4. Deploy the program (if needed):  
   ```bash
   anchor deploy  
   ```  

5. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   npm run dev  
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Connect your Solana wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button.  
2. Navigate to the "Create Stablecoin" section.  
3. Fill in the stablecoin details:  
   - Name  
   - Symbol  
   - Target Currency (USD, EUR, etc.)  
   - Select a bond for collateral  
   - Upload an icon (optional)  
4. Click "Create Stablecoin" to deploy your custom stablecoin.  
5. Use the "Mint" and "Redeem" functions to manage your stablecoin supply.  

## Smart Contract Architecture  
The project consists of several key components:  
- **StablecoinFactory**: Main program handling stablecoin creation and management.  
- **StablecoinData**: Account structure storing stablecoin metadata and configuration.  
- **Oracle Integration**: Price feed system using Switchboard for real-time exchange rates.
